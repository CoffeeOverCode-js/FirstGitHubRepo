                    My name is Ryan Fredericks, and I was born on May 20, 2005, in Cape Town, South Africa. I have many
                    passions and hobbies in life, including sports-shooting, playing the piano, fishing, and technology.
                    When I am passionate about something, I put in every ounce of effort possible. For instance, during
                    my
                    sports-shooting training, I would spend most Saturdays at the club from 7 am to 4 pm. Although it
                    was
                    tiring, it was worth it in the end because I managed to win many club tournaments and was selected
                    to
                    compete in the 2022 junior nationals for .22 LR sports-shooting.

                <h5 id="my-element2">How it all started.</h5>
                <div id="hidden-element2">
                    Growing up with both of my parents working as police officials for the government, I developed a
                    passion
                    for
                    sports-shooting. When I was between the ages of 9 and 12, my dad joined a club called SA Jagters,
                    and I
                    started attending annual junior camps where I learned about survival techniques and gun safety. This
                    was
                    the
                    start of my competitive journey in sports-shooting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fast forward to 2020, and I have grown immensely as a shooter, becoming one of the best juniors in
                    long
                    gun
                    shoots. We decided to join another club in False Bay, which was more convenient for us since it was
                    closer
                    than our previous club. Although we continued to participate in tournaments at our other club, we
                    practiced
                    at the False Bay club.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During my time at the False Bay club, I had the opportunity to meet one of my dad's colleagues, who
                    is
                    now
                    my instructor. He introduced me to the 9mm handgun, and after seeing promise in me, he invested even
                    more
                    time and money in my training. Thanks to his guidance, I earned a Distinguished Master certificate
                    in
                    9mm
                    handgun shooting, which requires an average score of 94-97%.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the next two years, I continued to excel in handgun shoots and won four more Distinguished
                    Master
                    certificates. In 2022, I was selected to compete in the nationals for .22LR sports-shooting in
                    Welkom,
                    Johannesburg, and in 2023, I achieved my greatest accomplishment: the High Master certificate for
                    .22LR
                    sports-shooting. I am extremely proud of myself for all the hard work and countless hours I have put
                    into
                    sports-shooting.</p>
